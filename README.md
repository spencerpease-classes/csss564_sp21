## Description

Bayesian statistics provides a formal framework for a well-principled and
dynamic approach to uncertainty quantification, including best practices for
updating our beliefs as new data become available. This course provides a broad
theoretical and methodological overview of Bayesian statistics, with a focus on
gaining theoretical, practical, and computational proficiency when applying
Bayesian methods to diverse datasets of social-scientific interest.
